                <p>As I'm writing this, <b><i>the sun scorches my back with its unbearable heat.</i></b> I hate summer weather. I usually spend my summers doing art camps, reading, playing video games, and sometimes visiting Singapore. I was born in Toronto, Canada in 2004. I later moved in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A., followed by Singapore, then Chicago. When I was younger, I wrote a lot of poetry, but then I later spent my time using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop.</p>
