                <p>As I'm writing this, <b><i>the sun scorches my back with its unbearable heat.</i></b> I hate summer weather. I usually spend my summers doing art camps, reading, playing video games, and sometimes visiting Singapore. My name is Rei Kong and I attend Walter Payton College Prep. I was born in Toronto, Canada in 2004. I later moved to Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A., followed by Singapore, then finally back to Chicago. When I was younger, I wrote a lot of poetry, but then I later spent my time using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop. Soon after, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and some Python through various camps I attended.</p>
